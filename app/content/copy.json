					"It’s generally hard for climatologists to predict what kind of a year it will be for snowpack, though global climate events like El Nino and La Nina often impact western weather. But snow accumulation is only one part of the story, since the climate of the region matters too. In 2012, some farmers ran out of their river irrigation water partway through the season, even as scorching temperatures continued and rain never came. Those that could drew heavily from the aquifer, pumping groundwater up to their fields when river water ran out. This year, irrigation demands were slow to start because of a cool, wet spring. Combined with a high snowpack runoff season, reservoirs along the North Platte River had time to fill, banking water for another dry year in the future."

					"The 100th meridian is often considered a dividing line between the western and eastern United States. As settlers learned, rainfall averages less than 20 inches a year west of this line; not a sustainable source of water for agriculture and industry. But snow collected in the mountains each winter, melting into torrential, sometimes flooding, rivers in the spring. And western pioneers were nothing if not enterprising. Early settlers capitalized on this resource by building irrigation systems to divert high spring runoff that would last through early summer. But each year the water would run out, abandoning crops and residents to the exactitudes of the sun and wind during the hottest time of the year. Thus began the concept of “reclaiming” western lands: restructuring natural water systems for human use through massive, federally-sponsored irrigation projects."
				},{ "graf":
					"Driven by growing public pressure from westerners, in the late 1800s, Congress passed a series of acts to encourage and study the development of irrigation in the west. But it wasn’t until President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Reclamation Act in 1902 that the federal government seriously invested in western irrigation projects. Then the newly-minted U.S. Reclamation Service began to build dams and reservoirs to store water and essentially “re-time” high spring flows to deliver a steady water supply to agricultural users and municipalities throughout the year. They authorized 25 projects between 1903 and 1906."

Situated just below where the Sweetwater River flows into the North Platte River, the site is remote, even today. And even by today’s standards, the 214 foot-high dam and its complementary dike were an enormous undertaking. Machinery had to be hauled in from Casper, 47 miles to the north. Granite quarried from local hills was hewn into huge blocks to create the arch-style structure, 97 feet thick at the base narrowing to a mere 11 feet at the top. The top spans the girth of Fremont Canyon, offering dramatic views down steep sides to the river below. To the south, more than one million acre-feet of mountain snowmelt can collect in Pathfinder Reservoir. After five long years of construction, it was completed in 1909."
