                        <p>Born in the high reaches of the Rocky Mountains, the headwaters of the North Platte River flow down to form a channel that winds across the Wyoming-Colorado state line. The river runs free across yellow-brown sagebrush steppe until it backs up behind Seminoe, the first of several major dams north of Sinclair, Wyoming.</p>
                        
                        <p>Aside from a few small dams and diversions close to the headwaters, the river has been mostly wild and untamed. Here the water intersects with the course of historic westward expansion and the demands of humans who bent waterways to their will.</p>
                        
                        <p>During the last century, that force altered the annual water cycle that existed for millennia. River water no longer races out of the mountains each spring, leaving the Plains dry by early summer. It’s now carefully managed on a landscape that has been “reclaimed.”</p>

                        <p>Spurred by the fur trade, gold rush, and the Homestead Act of 1862, pioneering men and women set out to colonize the American West, looking for a place to raise their families and make a living from the land. Settlers coming from the lush, rain-fed East found western lands dauntingly dry, and quickly experienced the difficulty of relying solely upon the region’s capricious rainfall. Though early western boosters lured settlers by suggesting that “rain follows the plow” and the climate was getting wetter, those who arrived soon found the climate closer to Major Stephen H. Long’s description of the “Great American Desert.” Without a reliable source of water, there was no way to develop the expansive land that seemed so full of promise.</p>
                        
                        <p>The 100<sup>th</sup> meridian is often considered a dividing line between the western and eastern United States. As settlers learned, rainfall averages less than 20 inches a year west of this line, not a sustainable source of water for agriculture and industry. But snow collected in the mountains each winter, flooding riverbeds in the spring. And western pioneers were nothing if not enterprising. Early settlers capitalized on this resource by building irrigation systems to divert high spring runoff. But many years the river water would only last through early summer, abandoning crops and residents to the exactitudes of the sun and wind during the hottest time of the year. Thus began the concept of “reclaiming” western lands: restructuring natural water systems for human use through massive, federally-sponsored irrigation projects.</p>

                        <p>Driven by growing public pressure from westerners, Congress passed a series of acts in the late 1800s to encourage and study the development of irrigation in the west. But it wasn’t until President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Reclamation Act in 1902 that the federal government seriously invested in western irrigation projects. Then the newly-minted U.S. Reclamation Service (today's U.S. Bureau of Reclamation) began to build dams and reservoirs to store water and essentially <span class="inline-video-btn" id="play-lyle"><i class="fa fa-play"></i> "re-time"</span><span class="mama-bear">"re-time"</span> high spring flows to deliver a steady water supply to agricultural users and municipalities throughout the year. The agency authorized nearly 25 projects between 1903 and 1906.</p>

                        <p>One of the first of these projects was Pathfinder Dam, named in honor of one of the West’s most intrepid explorers, John C. Fremont, who explored the canyon where the dam sits.</p>

Today the project provides water to nearly 335,000 acres in eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the twentieth century progressed, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation built more dams, reservoirs and power plants on the North Platte River to generate electricity and supply irrigation water, and a complex system of water management emerged.</p>

                        <p>Water rights west of the Missouri River generally follow the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, commonly explained as “first in time, first in right.” But from the beginning of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s history, navigating myriad water rights has been a challenging yet critical piece of the puzzle.</p>
                        
                        <p>As North Platte River water moves from Colorado to fields in Wyoming and Nebraska, it’s carefully accounted for and divvied up. Many interests have a share in it: from agriculture to cities to federally-protected wildlife. In the West, few issues are as contentious as water.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 1934, Nebraska sued Wyoming over the amount of North Platte River water it received.</p>
                        
                        <p>“It’s basic water history in the West,” Matt Hoobler with the Wyoming State Engineer’s Office said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re Kansas to Colorado, or California to Colorado or California to Wyoming, it doesn’t matter. Downstream states look upstream for more water.”</p>

                        <p>The 1945 ruling split the natural water flows of the river 75 percent to Nebraska and 25 percent to Wyoming, in accordance with the amount of land under agricultural production. Nebraska returned to the court in 1986, accusing Wyoming of taking more than its share of water, and in 2001 the court issued a new decree which further restricted Wyoming's consumptive water use.</p>
                        
                        <p>On the North Platte system, all of these complicated water allotments are implemented from one central place, the Bureau of Reclamation’s Wyoming Area Office in Casper. On a recent visit, the drab building matched the overcast sky.</p>
                        
                        <p>In a small office, highly-trained operators sit in front of multiple computer screens, controlling water in three different states: Wyoming, Colorado and Montana. They work around the clock, serving as the operators, security, and emergency personnel for all the dams and reservoirs, and coordinating power supply with the federal Western Area Power Administration (which markets and transmits electricity across 15 states). They follow target flow orders from three different state water offices, Ray Balerio, control room supervisor said. Operators are always scanning their water and data logs, continuously making minor adjustments across the system to keep them on track.</p>

                        <p>“It is amazing with the push of a button we can release so much water. Just by selecting a power plant and pushing a button,” Balerio said. In his 25 years at the office, he’s seen all kinds of events. He laughed when asked whether droughts or floods are easier to respond to, and said both often prove challenging.</p>
                        
                        <p>“When you have a lot of water everything’s running full bore, everything’s going out full maximum so you don’t have a lot of changes. But during the drought season you’re trying to conserve water so you’re watching every drop... which is really stressful because you may be doing 15 changes every two hours,” Balerio said.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each year, this office depends upon the snowpack data gathered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service to make judgments based on how much water will be coming down from the mountains east of the Continental Divide.</p>
                        
                        <p>Lyle Myler, deputy area manager for the office, is tall, with a voice that carries just a hint of a drawl. Myler is a veteran water manager. He’s been with the office for 24 years and can rattle off facts and figures from any of their systems with ease.</p>
                        
                        <p>“We do a forecast beginning February 1 that gives an estimate of the volume of water that we think we’re going to get in four months. That gives us a feel for how we start positioning water in the reservoirs,” Myler said.</p>
                        
                        <p>His office continues to check those forecasts each month, using data from prior years to estimate runoff and predict their summer water supply, including how much water will make it out to downstream irrigators from May through September.</p>

                        <p>“[In 2014] we had a good run-off season,” Myler said, with more than one million acre feet coming into the upper river system from snowmelt and rain. On average, it’s about 700,000 acre-feet. “The two previous years [2012 and 2013] saw well-below average inflows so the supply was quite depleted.” Those years offered a striking contrast to the huge water year of 2011, when the system received more than two million acre-feet of water.</p>
                        
                        <p>Like most other western river basins, the accounting and managing of water on the North Platte River is complex, and the water flowing through the intricate network is vital to the survival of ranchers, farmers, cities and wildlife.</p>
                        
                        <p>Today, during an average water year, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation projects deliver water to roughly one-third of the irrigated acreage and people in western states. Without “reclaiming” or bringing western watersheds under human control, nothing in the region would be the same.</p>
