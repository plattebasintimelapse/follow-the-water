                        <p>Born in the high reaches of the Rocky Mountains, the headwaters of the North Platte River trickle down in ice-cold tributaries to form a channel that winds across the Wyoming-Colorado state line. The river runs free across yellow-brown sagebrush steppe until it backs up behind Seminoe, the first of several dams north of Sinclair, Wyo.</p>
                        
                        <p>Until this point the river has been mostly wild and untamed. Here the water intersects the course of westward expansion and the demands of humans who bent waterways to their will.</p>
                        
                        <p>The 100th meridian is often considered a dividing line between the western and eastern United States. As settlers learned, rainfall averages less than 20 inches a year west of this line; not a sustainable source of water for agriculture and industry. But snow collected in the mountains each winter, melting into torrential, sometimes flooding, rivers in the spring. And western pioneers were nothing if not enterprising. Early settlers capitalized on this resource by building irrigation systems to divert high spring runoff that would last through early summer. But each year the water would run out, abandoning crops and residents to the exactitudes of the sun and wind during the hottest time of the year. Thus began the concept of “reclaiming” western lands: restructuring natural water systems for human use through massive, federally-sponsored irrigation projects.</p>
                        
                        <p>Driven by growing public pressure from westerners, in the late 1800s, Congress passed a series of acts to encourage and study the development of irrigation in the west. But it wasn’t until President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Reclamation Act in 1902 that the federal government seriously invested in western irrigation projects. Then the newly-minted U.S. Reclamation Service began to build dams and reservoirs to store water and essentially “re-time” high spring flows to deliver a steady water supply to agricultural users and municipalities throughout the year. They authorized 25 projects between 1903 and 1906.</p>
                        
                        <p>The second of these projects, named in honor of one of the West’s most intrepid explorers, John C. Fremont, was Pathfinder Dam.</p>

                        <p>Pathfinder was the first major piece of the North Platte Project, one of several huge irrigation projects that determined the history of the American West by providing a reliable water supply to dry agricultural lands, industries and burgeoning cities. Today the project provides water to around 335,000 acres in eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the twentieth century progressed, more water rights were acquired on the North Platte River. Dams, reservoirs and power plants were built to generate hydroelectric power and supply water for irrigated land north of Casper and for the Missouri River Basin, and a complex system of water management emerged.</p>
                        
                        <p>Water rights west of the Missouri River generally follow the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, commonly explained as “first in time, first in right.” But from the beginning of the Bureau of Reclamation’s history, navigating myriad water rights has been a challenging yet critical piece of the puzzle.</p>
                        
                        <p>As North Platte River water moves from Colorado all the way down to fields in Nebraska, it’s carefully accounted for and divvyed up. Many interests have a share in it: farmers and ranchers to cities to even a few birds and fish, federally protected under the 1973 Endangered Species Act. In the Plains and West, few issues are as contentious as water, and few require such an arsenal of lawyers.</p>

                        <p>The river has been subject to a few different lawsuits since the North Platte Project was built. In 1934 Nebraska sued Wyoming over the amount of North Platte River it water it received.</p>
                        
                        <p>“It’s basic water history in the West,” says Matt Hoobler with the Wyoming State Engineer’s Office. “It doesn’t matter if you’re Kansas to Colorado, or California to Colorado or California to Wyoming, it doesn’t matter. Downstream states look upstream for more water.”</p>
                        
                        <p>The ruling fell in favor of Nebraska, splitting the water 75 percent/25 percent between it and Wyoming, respectively, because of the amount of land under agricultural production. That agreement still holds today.</p>
                        
                        <p>On the North Platte system, all of these complicated agreements and allotments are controlled from one central place, the Bureau of Reclamation’s Wyoming Area Office in Casper. On a visit one recent morning, the drab official-looking building matched the overcast sky.</p>

Each year, Myler’s office depends upon the snowpack data gathered by the Natural Conservation Resource Service and Wyoming State Engineer’s Office to make judgments based on how much water will be coming down from the mountains.</p>

                        <p>“We do a forecast beginning February 1st that gives an estimate of the volume of water that we think we’re going to get in four months. That gives us a feel for how we start positioning water in the reservoirs,” says Myler. Tall, with an easy smile and voice that carries just a hint of drawl, Myler is a veteran water manager. He’s been with the office for 24 years and can rattle off facts and figures from any of their systems with ease.</p>
                        
                        <p>“We keep track of the storage we deliver out and how much of that water is Glendo storage water, how much is Kendrick water, how much is North Platte storage,” says Myler. “The thing that’s difficult to judge is if you get a big rain event, how is that going to affect the volume that comes in?  So, it keeps us busy.”</p>
                        
                        <p>In a small office inside the building, highly-trained operators sit in front of multiple computer screens, controlling water in three different states: Wyoming, Colorado and Montana. They work around the clock year-round, serving as the operators, security, and emergency personnel for all the dams and reservoirs, and coordinating power supply with the Western Area Power Administration. They follow target flow orders from the three different state water offices, says Ray Balerio, control room supervisor. Operators are always scanning their water and data logs, especially at volatile locations, continuously make minor adjustments across the system to keep them on track.</p>

                        <p>It is amazing with the push of a button we can release so much water. Just by selecting a power plant and pushing a button,” says Balerio. In his 25 years at the office, he’s seen all kinds of events, and laughs when asked which is easier: responding to droughts and floods, saying both often prove challenging.</p>
                        
                        <p>“When you have a lot of water everything’s running full bore, everything’s going out full maximum so you don’t have a lot of changes. But during the drought season you’re trying to conserve water so you’re watching every drop so you have a lot of changes which is really stressful because you may be doing 15 changes every two hours,” says Balerio.</p>
                        
                        <p>Guernsey Reservoir, completed in 1927, is also part of the North Platte Project. It sits at the very end of the chain of seven dams and reservoirs carrying water through eastern Wyoming, the last in line to release water to the east. On this river system the irrigation season runs May 1st through September 30th, at which point the Bureau of Reclamation shuts the gates at Guernsey, holding back the rest of the water until the following year.</p>
                        
                        <p>“This year we had a good run-off season,” says Myler, with more than one million acre feet coming into the upper river system from snow melt runoff and rain. On average, it’s about 700,000 acre-feet. “The two previous years [2013 and 2012] saw well-below average inflows so the supply was quite depleted. It took a big amount of water to fill it up, but we got it full.” Those years offered a striking contrast to the huge water year of 2011, when the system received more than two million acre-feet of water.</p>
                        
                        <p>Like most other western river basins, the accounting and managing of water on the North Platte River is complex. And like most other river basins, the water flowing through the complicated network is vital to the survival of ranchers, farmers, cities and wildlife downstream.</p>
                        
                        <p>The North Platte Project embodies the story of the settling of the American West. Today, during an average water year, Bureau of Reclamation projects deliver water to roughly one-third of the irrigated acreage and people in western states. Without “reclaiming” or bringing western watersheds under human control, nothing in the arid west would be the same; agriculture, industry, cities and towns.</p>
