                        <p>The sharp peaks of the Nokhu Crags emerge slowly and gracefully above a dark ridge of pine on the steep climb to Lake Agnes. The trail ends on a rocky outcropping above a lake of black glass, where the sides of snowy mountains slide down to the shore. Winter winds whip around this remote alpine spot, near the headwaters of the North Platte River.</p>
                        
                        <p>As it has for centuries, water arrives annually to these mountains as snow and ice, collecting at high elevations to wait for spring’s warmth. In the arid west, the majority of the water that fills streams and rivers comes from winter snowpack. Every year, farmers, raft guides, conservationists, fishermen, city planners and others wait anxiously to see what winter will bring.</p>
                        
                        <p>The answer is the difference between a good year and a bad one. Water is the life and livelihood of downstream users, and it all starts high in the mountains with a single snowflake.</p>
                        
                        <p>Ski fanatics know exactly how much fresh powder each storm brings to their mountains. But others track that data, too. For the last 100 years, January is when the annual cycle of water management begins, as hydrologists answer a critical question: how much water is up there this year?</p>

Today she’s at the Joe Wright SNOTEL site in the Cache la Poudre drainage, part of the South Platte River Basin.</p>

It acts like a liquid scale, measuring the weight of the snow and converting it to total water content of the snowpack. SNOTEL stands for “snowpack telemetry”—basically remote data collection and transmission. Every year more than 700 remote stations like this one track snowpack and climate data across the West. That’s especially critical in Colorado. </p>

                        <p>“This is the headwater state, so this is where all of your water is coming from,” Hultstrand said, “with the exception of whatever precipitation is received in spring and summer. But really, this is the bulk of it.”</p>
                        
                        <p>The SNOTEL system has been in place for decades, transmitting data back to centralized offices where it’s assessed and compiled into public reports. But it complements an even older method of data collection: manual snow surveys. From January through May, teams go out to specific locations--the same ones year after year--to collect information about snowpack. They ski or snowshoe through forests heavy with snow to the more remote sites, weathering sleet, blizzards or ice storms.</p>

                        <p>A University of Nevada professor named Frank Church pioneered the system of snow surveying in 1905.</p>
                        
                        <p>“He wanted to find a better way of forecasting runoff,” Matt Hoobler said. And his method proved durable: during the last century, things haven’t changed much. Hoobler is a snow surveyor with the Wyoming State Engineer's Office who conducts manual surveys each winter. “The basic premise of filling a tube full of snow and weighing it...we do something very similar today,” Hoobler said.</p>
                        
                        <p>Near the summit of Interstate 80 in southeastern Wyoming, weak sunlight makes its way through the thin air to where Hoobler is taking a core sample of the snowpack. He carefully holds a specially calibrated cylinder, which measures snow depth, weight, and density, then drops it vertically into the snow, twists it, and pulls it back out to analyze.</p>
                        
                        <p>“Water content at this site is 5.5 inches,” Hoobler said. “That means if this snow was to melt instantaneously, there’d be 5.5 inches of water sitting in this meadow.”</p>

Understanding the relationship between snowpack and water supply is critical, he said. </p>
                        
                        <p>“The main reason we’re up here for snow survey is for river forecasting. In other words, once it all turns to water, how much water is going to exist in our rivers and our reservoirs,” Hoobler said.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each year surveyors add new data to the collection, validating the record and improving accuracy. The field data coming in from snow surveys and SNOTEL sites, including precipitation, is compiled into monthly stream flow forecasts for the spring and summer. That information is critical to many diverse downstream users, especially farmers who rely on irrigation water.</p>
                        
                        <p>Basin-wide water users generally start to make decisions based upon the April 1st report. Knowing if the water supply is above or below average can determine a boom or bust year for crops, if rancher have to sell their cows, if migrating birds will have adequate nesting habitat, if raft guides will have summer employment.</p>

                        <p>All year, SNOTEL sites record snowpack data across the mountains of the American West. Each line in this graph represents the highest snow water equivalency measured for a few selected SNOTEL sites within the North Platte River Basin in northern Colorado for the last decade.</p>

                        <p>While sites receive different amounts of snowfall due to their location, taken together these sites demonstrate the wide variability of snowpack from year to year.</p>

                        <p>In the last decade, the North Platte River Basin has seen the highest snowpack in 30 years in 2011, followed by one of the lowest snowpack years on record in 2012. In any given year, it's difficult to predict how much snow a mountain range will receive.</p>

                        <p>“Society depends on water -- whether it’s growing the crops we’re going to eat or producing hydroelectric power. 50 to 80 percent of flows of North Platte River depend on this white stuff – snow,” Hoobler said. </p>
                        
                        <p>Because quantity and quality of snowpack is the source of water for so many uses, a dry year can cause a cascade of impacts, flowing all the way down to a farmer’s beet crop in the Nebraska panhandle. The past three years have seen two snowpack extremes: the huge water year of 2011 followed by 2012, the hottest and driest on record for many places in the intermountain west and plains. 2013 remained drier than average, but 2014 has once again proven to be a big water year in the mountains. That wide variability, Hoobler said, is “what makes farmers pray for rain and snow.”</p>

                        <p>It’s generally hard for climatologists to predict what kind of a year it will be for snowpack, though global climate events like El Nino and La Nina often impact western weather. But snow accumulation is only one part of the story, since the climate of the region matters too. In 2012, some farmers ran out of their river irrigation water partway through the season, even as scorching temperatures continued and rain never came. Those that could drew heavily from the aquifer, pumping groundwater up to their fields when river water ran out. This year, irrigation demands were slow to start because of a cool, wet spring. Combined with a high snowpack runoff season, reservoirs along the North Platte River had time to fill, banking water for another dry year in the future.</p>
                        
                        <p>As winter relaxes into spring, that massive quantity of water stored high in the mountains begins to melt and make its way into streams and rivers, where it is channeled through dams and reservoirs to feed crops. The North Platte River starts to creep north from Colorado into Wyoming, where it meets the first of several stops along the way to a farmer’s field.</p>
